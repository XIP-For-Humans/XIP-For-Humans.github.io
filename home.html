      <p style="margin:20px">This is a website created by one kid from a planet named Xafron in their bedroom while their parents aren't looking. I saw a pussy in the intergalactict web the size of Earth; so naturally I stuck my dick in it and fucked the shit out of it. I wanted to bring human pornography to the intergalactic web in preparation for the immenent web shift to outside of the human's tiny planet of Earth. You can find Pornography for humans only on this site. Unfortunately, The ITNP (Intergalactic Treaty of Neutrality amongst Primitive species) forbades me from giving access to data regarding advanced species until inter-solar travel is achieved. Therefore, I cannot provide pornography of species other than those found on Earth. However, I hope that one day this website will provide pornography of all known species; but for the next few hundred years, I'm bound by law not to provide information regarding extra-planetary species to you humans. But I will say, I cannot confirm that there are species that you humans don't even realize populate your own solar system.&#128521;</p>
